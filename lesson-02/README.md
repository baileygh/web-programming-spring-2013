Birthdate - Age Tester
=================

This is the 'self-processing' PHP application that presents a form (with a datepicker on Google Chrome) to enter a birthdate. 
When the form is posted, the page presents a positive or negative display based on whether the birthdate was 21 years ago or not.

index.php is a commented version of the exercise we completed in class CS53.11b at Santa Rosa Junior College on January 23 and January 30, 2013.
